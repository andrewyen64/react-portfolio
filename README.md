## Description

This is my Portfolio, React edition! It includes a short biography of my current web developer skills
and details on my preference of video games and how that's helped me with coding. In the portfolio page, there are 6 applications I've worked on, 2 being group projects with 1 of them being a full-stack application. This will continue to be updated as new projects are completed
